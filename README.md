## Game play
In this game, we have a character that moves only in the y-direction, starting from a fixed point, which is the green ground of the background. They change their situation; if you click right, it appears as the Normal Situation, and if you click left, it shows the Ready Situation

```Java
void NormalSituation() {
    image(CharacterImage1, CharacterX, CharacterY-(CharacterHeight/2), CharacterWidth, CharacterHeight);
}

void ReadySituation() {
    image(CharacterImage2, CharacterX, CharacterY-(CharacterHeight/2), CharacterWidth, CharacterHeight);
}      

void UpdateY() {
    CharacterY=mouseY >=370? 370: mouseY;
}
```
The arrows in the game indicate the character's y-direction and move horizontally (in the x-direction) at a constant speed.
```Java
private float ArrowX=70;
  private float ArrowY;
float getX(){
    return ArrowX;
}

float getY(){
    return ArrowY;
}

void display() {
    image(ArrowPhoto, ArrowX, ArrowY, 100, 100);
}

void ObjectPosition() {
    if (ArrowX < (width + 5)) {
        ArrowX += 8;
    } else {
        Hide = true;
    }
}
```


In Level One, the red balloons move in the y-direction at a constant speed, with each one spaced apart from the others in the x-direction

In Level 2, there are 15 balloons, with 12 of them being red balloons. They move in the y-direction with constant speed but appear on the screen from different positions.

```Java 
// this is the parent class of balloons
public void  setBallonXLevel(float x){
    BallonXLevel=x;
  }
  public  void  setBallonYLevel(float y){
    BallonYLevel=y;
  }
  public float getBallonXLevel(){
   return BallonXLevel; 
  }
  public float getBallonYLevel(){
   return BallonYLevel; 
  }
  ```
  ```Java
  // this is the class RedBallon

class RedBallon extends Ballon {
  RedBallon(int d) {
    setBallonXLevel(getBallonXLevel() + d);
  }
   
  RedBallon(int d, float initialY) {
    setBallonXLevel(getBallonXLevel() + d);
     setBallonYLevel(initialY);
  }

  void displayBallonLevel1(PImage RedBallonPhoto) {
    image(RedBallonPhoto, getBallonXLevel(), getBallonYLevel(), 80, 80);
  }

  void UpdateBallonLevel2() {
    this.UpdateBallonLevel1();
  }

    void UpdateBallonLevel1() {
     super.setBallonYLevel((getBallonYLevel() -2 ) < - 90 ? 350 : (getBallonYLevel() - 2));
  } 
  
  }
```
And there are 3 yellow balloons; they move in the y-direction at different speeds and accelerations, adding an extra challenge to Level 2


In the game, if you lose in level 1, you will try level 1 again. If you win, you will proceed to level 2. If you lose in level 2, you will retry level 2 again and not return to level 1
